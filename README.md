Year 1 Module CI401 Semester 2 Programming Coursework

A simple implementation of an ATM. 

The assessment provides a "shell" which is constructed in JavaFx this allows some students to focus more on the logical 
portion of the code instead of the UI elements. 

Year 1 assessment scope is about reviewing simple coding techniques such as: 
* For loops 
* String to integer conversion
* Use of ArrayList - other Collections have not been introduced yet.
* Minimal encapsulation
* Minimal inheritance - Interfacing has not to been introduced yet.
* Mutablility - state object was used across classes in the original UI shell.
* Javadoc 
* Testing - JUnit has not been introduced yet.


## Restrictions: 
* Code that does not strive to far from the assessment scope.
* No Maven/Groovy
* Local code only i.e. No sockets etc.
* Minimal database code - single database where seperate ones would be more appropriate.
